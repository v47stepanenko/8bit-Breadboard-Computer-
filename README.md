Uploaded the Arduino sketches for:

1. Basic Arduino programmer for EEPROM chips;

2. Programming an EEPROM to be used to decode 8-bit values and drive a 4-digit 7-segment display;

3. Programming a pair of EEPROMs to serve as an instruction decoder for an 8-bit breadboard computer + flags register support.
